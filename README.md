This is a simple authentication system built with Expo and Google Cloud. It uses the `expo-auth-session` package for OAuth flows and Google Cloud for user authentication.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Expo CLI
- A Google Cloud account

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AUTHSYSExpo.git`
2. Install NPM packages: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Create a new project in the Google Cloud Console, enable the Google OAuth API, and get your client ID.
4. Replace the `clientId` variable in the `Dashboard` component with your Google OAuth client ID.
5. Start the Expo server: `expo start`

## 🎮 Usage

When you open the app, you will see a login button. Clicking this button will redirect you to a Google sign in page. After signing in with your Google account, you will be redirected back to the app and logged in.
